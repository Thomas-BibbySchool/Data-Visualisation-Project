    <h1>Welcome to Our Data Visualization Project</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to our project's homepage where we delve into the impacts of workforce
        diversity in healthcare systems around the globe. This site features interactive visualizations that explore
        the correlation between the makeup of healthcare staff and overall healthcare system performance. Whether
        you're a policymaker, healthcare administrator, or simply interested in global health trends, these
        visualizations will provide valuable insights.

        <li><strong>Scatter Plot Visualization:</strong> Explore the relationship between the percentage of foreign-trained doctors and healthcare performance across different countries.</li>
        <li><strong>Heatmap and Line Graph Visualization:</strong> Visualize the distribution of foreign-trained medical staff globally and observe how these ratios affect healthcare outcomes over time.</li>
